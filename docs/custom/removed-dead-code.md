# Removed: Dead Code (Phase 7 Batch 1)

## Summary

Removed directories, files, and standalone functions with zero callers — vestigial leftovers from earlier cleanup phases (Phases 1-6) where wiring was removed but the definitions were never deleted.

## Removed Directories

| Path | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| `internal/htmlsanitize/` | Zero importers after the browser-login / OAuth flows were removed in Phase 3. |
| `internal/cache/` | Zero importers — request-signature cache wiring was removed in Phase 6. |
| `sdk/pluginabi/` | Plugin host was removed in Phase 2; package had no non-test, non-example callers. |
| `examples/plugin/` | Entire plugin examples tree. Only built against the removed plugin host. |

### Note on `sdk/pluginapi/`

The audit suggested deleting `sdk/pluginapi/` as well, but on re-verification it is **not** dead: it remains imported by the intentionally-retained extension-point interfaces listed in [removed-plugins.md](./removed-plugins.md) (`PluginInterceptorHost`, `PluginModelRouterHost`, `PluginExecutorHost`, `PluginScheduler`, `PluginAuthParser`, `PluginHooks`) and is in the `cmd/server` dependency tree. Per task instructions ("If something has callers, do NOT delete it"), this package was kept.

## Removed Files in `internal/misc/`

| File | Symbols verified with zero callers |
| --- | --- |
| `mime-type.go` | `misc.MimeTypes` |
| `oauth.go` | `misc.GenerateRandomState`, `misc.ParseOAuthCallback`, `misc.OAuthCallback`, `misc.AsyncPrompt` |
| `copy-example-config.go` | `misc.CopyConfigTemplate` |
| `claude_code_instructions.go` + `claude_code_instructions.txt` | `misc.ClaudeCodeInstructions` |

## Trimmed: `internal/misc/credentials.go`

The file previously held three helpers. Two had zero callers and were removed; the third is still used by the model registry and was kept.

| Function | Disposition |
| --- | --- |
| `LogSavingCredentials` | Removed (zero callers) |
| `MergeMetadata` | Removed (zero callers) |
| `LogCredentialSeparator` | **Kept** — called from `internal/registry/model_registry.go` |

The file now contains only `credentialSeparator` and `LogCredentialSeparator`.

## AGENTS.md Updates

Removed two stale architecture lines that referenced deleted code:

- `internal/api/modules/amp/` — directory never existed.
- `internal/cache/` — package deleted in this batch.

## Rationale

Each removal was verified by `grep -r <symbol> --include="*.go"` to confirm zero callers in the current tree. The build, unit tests, integration tests, and a smoke test (`/v1/models`, `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v0/management/config`) all pass after removal.

## Key Deleted Paths

- `internal/htmlsanitize/htmlsanitize.go`, `internal/htmlsanitize/htmlsanitize_test.go`
- `internal/cache/signature_cache.go`, `internal/cache/signature_cache_test.go`
- `sdk/pluginabi/types.go`, `sdk/pluginabi/types_test.go`
- `examples/plugin/` (full tree: `auth/`, `cli/`, `executor/`, `host-callback/`, `host-model-callback/`, `management-api/`, `model/`, `protocol-format/`, `request-normalizer/`, `request-translator/`, `response-normalizer/`, `response-translator/`, `scheduler/`, `simple/`, `thinking/`, `usage/`, `claude-web-search-router/`, `codex-service-tier/`, `frontend-auth/`, `frontend-auth-exclusive/`, `host-callback-auth-files/`, plus `Makefile`, `README.md`, `README_CN.md`, `scripts/`)
- `internal/misc/mime-type.go`
- `internal/misc/oauth.go`
- `internal/misc/copy-example-config.go`
- `internal/misc/claude_code_instructions.go`
- `internal/misc/claude_code_instructions.txt`
